Monolog was created for dating a girl,but she turned me down.

Monolog is a fully functional LBS IM android application,you can try it [here](http://http://fir.im/monolog)

The rule is simple,app push a monolog and three user avatars,guess who worte this monolog,If correct,you can chat with the author.If not,refresh and guess next.

##How to use

eeeee...basicly,you can't get json data.I write the web-end by laravel 4.2.I still need to use the instructure for the next project.So till I write a new one,the web-end will temporarily not open.but you can use fiddler to find out my domain,till my fee runs out,I won't shut it down.

but it won't effect you build the app.

**you must find strings [YOURS] and change to your keys.**

##Where is the iOS version

Take it easy,the time will come.Pretty soon I guess.And the web-end will open too.

##Depends
many,u can find in gradle file.Here is Main depends.


	1.UMENG.For anaylist
	2.HUANXIN.For IM
	3.BAIDU MAP.For LBS

##What you can learn
All basic stuffs.


##Extra

This project is still avaliable in stores,so I will countiue update.

and as always.You can find store screenshot template file in \screenshot.

Those whom just change AD id and upload to stores are unwelcome.If I find out,I will shut service down.
